# Face Detection with OpenCV

This project is a basic implementation of face detection using OpenCV in Python. It is currently a work in progress and will be expanded further in the future.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Done So Far:
- Set up the project environment.
- Installed OpenCV and verified its functionality.
- Created an initial script for testing OpenCV.

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps:
- Implement face detection using Haar cascades or deep learning-based methods.
- Optimize and test with different datasets.
- Improve performance and accuracy.

## ðŸ“Œ Status:
This project is currently **on hold** due to other ongoing work but will be revisited later.

## ðŸ’» Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sambhavi298/face-detection.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd face-detection

3. Install dependencies:
pip install opencv-python numpy

4. Run the initial test script:
python face_detection.py

Stay tuned for future updates! ðŸ˜Š
